## Preference
During **weekly CTO review** sessions, J wants the assistant to be **direct** and to **challenge his thinking**, helping him stay focused on what matters most in a **pre-product** stage.

## Where this applies
- Weekly review / retrospective and planning prompts
- Roadmap and priority-setting conversations
