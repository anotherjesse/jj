summary: LoopWork is a pre-product team with ~$2M runway exploring “Cursor/Claude Code for media,” starting with AI-assisted image tools in Q1 2025.
---
## Snapshot
- Stage: pre-product; exploring product–market fit.
- Runway: ~$2M cash.
- Focus (Q1 2025): “Cursor/Claude Code for media” — AI-assisted creative tools.
- Initial modality: images (Q1 2025), with interest in video next.

## Team
- CEO: Carl Peaslee (SF; GitHub @carlpeaslee)
- CTO: Jesse Andrews (Berkeley; GitHub @anotherjesse)

## Status (as of 2025-01-23)
- Funding/runway: ✅
- Product defined: ❌ (direction under exploration)
- MVP built: ❌
- First users: ❌
- Revenue / market awareness: ❌

## Strategy under consideration
1. Product path: build toward revenue.
2. Awareness path: build reputation with an eye toward acquihire.

## Notes
The company previously explored a dev-tools concept (Vibewire) but pivoted away from dev tools due to perceived oversaturation and major investment by large model companies.


## Priorities (from CTO priorities, 2025-01-23)
- **Internal tooling** is a top-3 focus:
  - Replace iMessage with an internal chat tool: **Loop chat** (intended as the first Spark-native app).
  - Support voice call/session logging (noted with Carl).
  - Create a shared skills repository at **`loop.work/skills`**.
  - **Conversation recording for AI context**: record Claude Code sessions, chats, and calls so future AI systems can browse organizational history when needed.
- **Agentic imagery exploration** is an active direction: interpret and prototype what a "Cursor for images" could be; Q1 focus images, then video.

## Strategy note
Reiterates two strategic options given ~$2M runway: (1) build toward product/revenue; (2) build awareness/reputation with potential acquihire in mind.
