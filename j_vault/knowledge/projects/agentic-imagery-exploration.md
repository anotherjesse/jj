summary: 'LoopWork Q1 project to prototype a “Cursor for images”: agentic workflows for image creation/editing and coding-like iteration (Cursor/Claude Code), inspired by Prologue CAD.'
---
## Summary
An exploration track at LoopWork to understand and prototype what a **"Cursor for images"** could bei.e., agentic workflows for image creation/editing.

## Questions being explored
- What does "agenticness" mean for media tools?
- What interaction model would make image iteration feel like coding in Cursor/Claude Code?

## Scope / sequencing
- **Q1 focus: images**, then video later.

## Related inspiration
- MattFs **Prologue CAD** pattern (referenced in `meetings/2026-01-24-mattf-prologue-cad.md`): generate variations, rapid human evaluation, and genetic algorithms as a creativity driver.
