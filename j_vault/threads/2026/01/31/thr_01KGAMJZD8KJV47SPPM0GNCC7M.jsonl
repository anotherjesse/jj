This apparently recurs annually.\n\n### AI/dev philosophy & tool architecture\nA recurring theme is building **accretive, composable systems** (“LEGO-like”), aligned with the **UNIX philosophy** (small tools, pipeable). JJ is moving away from a monolithic “**Vibewire**”-style approach toward independent modules:\n- A Rust **kanban** manager (proto with 5 columns).\n- **Sparks** (container/forking system).\n- Multiple specialized **coding agents**.\n\nThe kanban UX: dragging a task to **“ready”** triggers a new Claude coding session in a **fresh fork**. The architecture is described as RPC-style state management.\n\n### Sparks / infra details\nSparks enables near-instant environments with SSL + filesystem, fast **fork/snapshot** (claimed ~**0.25s**) via **btrfs** copy-on-write snapshots with diff tracking and streaming backups to **GCS**. An “**Eat My Data**” mode disables fsync in cloud contexts and uses **RAID10 local SSDs**, claiming up to **6,000×** disk speed improvement.\n\n### Skills vs MCP tools\n“Skills” are lightweight bundles (markdown instructions + scripts) that can be loaded probabilistically based on context (e.g., a frustration-triggered methodical debugging skill). Compared to MCP schemas, skills/CLI tooling are preferred for **context efficiency** and lighter-weight triggers.\n\n### Prologue CAD: product concept and GTM\n**Prologue CAD** is a 3-person team building an AI-powered CAD exploration tool optimized for **rapid forking and evaluation** (“**Tinder for CAD**”). Users swipe through many design variants on a canvas, with provenance tracking, and export **STEP files** to integrate with traditional CAD. The product emphasizes exploration over refinement, with a two-phase workflow (mass forking → basic editing) and built-in manufacturability checks (e.g., injection molding, CNC). GTM is positioned as **$40/mo** “where parts begin,” explicitly not trying to replace existing CAD.\n\n### Novelty injection via genetic algorithms\nA related effort (“**Luminate/Lluminate**” mentioned) uses genetic algorithms to drive novelty: fitness computed via **CLIP embedding** distances for diversity; mutation/crossover performed in **prompt space**; human feedback incorporated via **ELO-style** ranking. CAD can be rendered as **depth maps** and used with “Nano Banana Pro” image generation for realistic industrial mockups.\n\n## Source\n- Meeting transcript link: https://notes.granola.ai/t/2912f311-6d69-486b-bad7-de001cf2f35c-00demib2\n- Source ID: `src_01KGAMJZD7RGD1SHMHS18R8A2G`\n","confidence":0.78,"doc_path":"summaries/sources/2026-01-24-mattf-prologue-cad.md","sources_add":[{"event_ids":["src_01KGAMJZD7RGD1SHMHS18R8A2G"],"thread_id":""}],"tags_add":["source","meeting-notes","cad","sparks","skills","genetic-algorithms"],"title":"2026-01-24 — MattF: Prologue CAD, Sparks infra, skills vs MCP, and genetic novelty search","type":"source_summary"},"reason":"Create a source summary for the provided 2026-01-24 MattF Prologue CAD document, capturing key points relevant to JJ/LoopWork and linking to the source ID."},"reason":"Create a source summary for the provided 2026-01-24 MattF Prologue CAD document, capturing key points relevant to JJ/LoopWork and linking to the source ID."}
