The generator appears to prepend a top-level media/ folder, so it returned media/jj_vault/media/..., i.e. a duplicated \"media\" segment. The draw call tried to open that path but the file wasn't actually readable/available at that location (hence os error 2).\n\nNext steps I can take (pick one):\n- Re-run generate_image writing to jj_vault/diagnostics/sad-egg-test-2026-02-01.png (omit the extra \"media/\" in the argument) and then call draw. I expect the returned path will be media/jj_vault/diagnostics/... and draw should succeed.\n- Run a file-list of the media/ tree to confirm where the file actually exists.\n- Stop — you've got the error and will proceed.\n\nWhich do you want me to do?"}
