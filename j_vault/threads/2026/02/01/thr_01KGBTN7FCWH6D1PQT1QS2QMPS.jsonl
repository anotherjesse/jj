A lot of inner monologue or like inner thinking, like inside your head voices. Let me put it another way. What if you had a fast model mode where you keep getting a stream of conscious from me, but also from yourself? And what it is, is in the background, you can run this, um, whenever there's been some thoughts or a conversation. You can kick off a slow running process that is analyzing or doing some sort of research. It could be like, hey, it could even be like you prompt what you want to be thought about. And then your subconscious sort of goes away and thinks about it and comes back with an inner monologue. And what you do is you just add that inner monologue to your sort of sort of thoughts, but then your fast mode takes over and can quickly respond to that. It's sort of like your mouth just says whatever it wants to say based upon what's in the inner monologue and what I've said. And so all of the inner monologue should be helping add context as you think more and more during the converation!"}

So for the first version, I would probably make it so maybe there's a way that the model can say, like if it gets asked, if it's a big model, good question, okay. So it could be that Deep Thoughts tool gets called automatically every once in a while, yeah, we could do that. Like if a lot of conversation has happened without an explicit call from you, then what we should do is trigger it automatically. I'm not sure about like the slow job output schema needing to be super complicated now that I've, if we, maybe it's just, we're prompting it that like, this is your your inside thoughts, it won't be spoken aloud to the user. You could now decide what you want to reply. And then whatever the FAST model says is what we actually say. I think as far as incorporating it, automatically. We probably have to like, you know, not inject it while it's streaming to us. So we'll get queued up for the next call. As far as UX, I might want to see background thoughts or whatever, but I don't really think I do. I think my actual goal is to use a fast model that I can actually use voice with and not have to spend so much time looking at the screen.  I mean, noise control, background memos, etc. I think it would be good to have it plugged into J itself, U. And so we'll have all the same tools about memory and knowledge and search and things like that. And as it gets bigger and more context in it, you know, like maybe we just have to force a, like, a mode that's like reflect back and like condense down somehow.  The staleness or the slowness of the slow model is interesting because maybe what that, because like let's imagine it kicked off three of them and you know it's been pondering and we get the result back. Who's to say like the thing that it started after the first utterance versus the second and third is the right thing to keep or not? And so maybe there is a sort of like a integration phase from the inner monologue that has to decide that. but I think, though, that we're getting too far. Like, at the beginning, what we could do is start simple and go from there. And then there's all these sort of interesting-- this is just for me, so I'm not worried about privacy and recording. It's really-- this is-- I talk with you, and you talk with me. And that's the goal of this relationship. So two quick questions to nail down what you mean. I think I'm really thinking it would be interesting where if the inner monologue or, you know, maybe it could return inner monologue and also call tools as part of its process eventually, or maybe even at the beginning, so that way it could search thoughts. Yeah, so we should probably give deep thought, the ability to, you know, like look into things. And actually, maybe it could even see the conversation that's been happening so far, not just the question. So that way it knows all the context. So then as far as like the answer, again, like or the inner monologue, I think the structuredness goes back into the knowledge base maybe, and then the raw text is injected into the thread, but in a way that's mostly for you. I think the slow process could have an agentic loop and research tools and things like that. But maybe what it is is we end up with, you know, like maybe there's when something comes in, there's a router that decides like, oh, what tools do we need to load? Do we load in, you know, Twitter search or do we load in coding agents or, you know, what have you? ..."}

I’d treat this as a **background “deep-thought agent” that only feeds the mouth**, not a second voice you have to read.

Never blocks on deep-thought.\n- **DeepThought (slow model):** runs occasionally in background, can read full session transcript; returns “internal thoughts” for mouth to use next turn.\n\n**Triggering**\n- Automatic: after `N` user turns or `T` seconds since last deep-thought result, enqueue a DeepThought run.\n- Manual: `/think` or “JJ, think about that” explicitly enqueues one.\n\n**Execution**\n- DeepThought gets:\n  - last K tokens (or “since last deep-thought”) + a short session summary if you have one\n  - optional goal prompt (if manually invoked)\n- DeepThought may call tools (later), but for v0.1 you can start with **no tools** or just **knowledge search**.\n\n**Injection (important)**\n- DeepThought results are appended to the session as an **internal event** and only become available to the mouth on the **next mouth turn**.\n- No mid-stream interruptions.\n\n**Output format (simple, not fancy)**\nReturn a single blob like:\n- `hmm:` 1–2 sentence “maybe what’s going on / what to do next”\n- `thoughts:` longer scratchpad for the mouth only (not shown to you)\n- `questions_for_user:` (optional) clarifiers the mouth should ask next\n\nThat’s enough; no heavy schema until you see failure modes.\n\n## Two key design decisions\n1) **Staleness / multiple overlapping jobs**\n   - v0.1: allow only **one in-flight** DeepThought job per session. If a new trigger happens while one is running, either:\n     - ignore, or\n     - set a “rerun_needed” flag and rerun after completion.\n   This avoids the “3 jobs return out of order” problem entirely at first.\n\n2) **Tool/router complexity**\n   - v0.1: no router. DeepThought always runs the same way.\n   - v0.2+: add a router that decides whether DeepThought should (a) just synthesize, (b) search your knowledge, (c) do web research, (d) kick off coding agents, etc.\n\n## What I need from you to lock v0.1\n1) What should the auto-trigger be: **every N user messages** (e.g., 5) or **every T minutes** (e.g., 2 min), or both?\n2) For voice-first: should the mouth ever say something like “(thinking in background…)” or keep it totally silent unless the deep-thought changes the next answer noticeably?\n\nIf you answer those, I can turn this into an implementation checklist for JJ Gateway/OpenClaw (events, job queue, and the “internal event” injection)."}
