## Summary
This document is a lightweight, templated technical roadmap capturing a product’s early planning state. The **current phase** is **Discovery & Definition**, indicating that product scope and architecture are still being defined.

It lays out four milestone phases:
1. **Foundation**: define product scope, choose a technical stack, set up the development environment, and create an initial architecture.
2. **MVP**: build three unspecified “core features” and establish a basic deployment pipeline.
3. **Launch**: add user authentication, production infrastructure, monitoring/alerting, and complete an initial launch.
4. **Iteration**: integrate user feedback, optimize performance, and expand features.

A **current sprint/focus** section is present for the **week of 2025-01-23**, but both “This Week” and “Next Week” task lists are empty. A backlog section exists but is essentially blank (single dash placeholder). The document was **last updated 2025-01-23**.

## Key takeaways / implications
- The plan is at a high level with placeholders (core features undefined), consistent with early-stage discovery.
- Near-term process is intended to be sprint-based, but execution details have not been filled in yet.
