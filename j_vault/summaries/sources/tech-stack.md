## Summary
Document captures an early-stage **Technical Stack & Decisions** placeholder. All major stack choices are **TBD** across frontend (framework, styling, state management), backend (language, framework, database), infrastructure (hosting, CI/CD, monitoring), and third‑party services/integrations.

The only concrete information is a set of **constraints** shaping future decisions:
- Team size: **2-person team**, with **1 technical** contributor.
- Funding: **pre-funding / bootstrapped**.
- Priority: **speed to market is critical**.

Sections for “Technical Principles” and “Third-Party Services” exist but are not yet filled in. Last updated: **2025-01-23**.
