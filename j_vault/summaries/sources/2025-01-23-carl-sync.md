## Summary
This sync captures a set of immediate infrastructure/developer-experience blockers (primarily affecting Carl) and several architectural/product decisions for LoopWork’s “Spark native” app ecosystem.

**Jesse’s immediate priorities** were framed as pragmatic unblockers:
- **tmux terminal sizing in SSH sessions** (Carl’s #1 blocker): tmux not going full-screen; `Ctrl+L` then `reset` is a temporary workaround; blocks effective vim/ncurses workflows.
- **Postgres patterns** (timeboxed ~1 hour): establish a simple model for **persistent Postgres instances** (production) plus **throwaway/ephemeral instances** for testing/verification, and workable **backup + fork** flows for staging; `test_postgres.sh` exists as a reference.
- **SSH improvements**: current limitation of one connection per node; **SCP/SFTP not working** (blocks Zed integration); Zed “Z-links” for remote editing failing.
- **Dev Spark containers with KVM**: run Kate inside a container with networking; only needs to work from the dev node.

**Carl’s focus areas**: (1) Picnic development using latest Spark best practices; (2) Loop chat (positioned as the first Spark-native app); (3) deployment and improvements to **cl_draw**.

**Decisions/architecture patterns**:
- Create a **shared skills repository** at `loop.work/skills` to consolidate scattered skill definitions; begin with manual sync and evolve to a CLI; structure includes a skills directory with symlinks to Claude/agents.
- Maintain **separation between external vs. internal tooling**: Picnic requires standalone external capabilities; internal tools can reuse underlying skills, but avoid tight coupling that blocks external use.
- Adopt a **CLI-first pattern**: cl_draw as a CLI canvas-manipulation + AI illustration tool; potential `docs.loop.work` with a Prosemirror editor; chat UI backed by a CLI backend.

**Operational gap identified**: a recurring deployment issue around **port 8080** indicates missing standardized HTTP service patterns across projects.

**Key insight**: “Spark native app” means an agentic computing framework built on Spark; being Spark-native does **not** imply coupling to internal systems.

## Stated next steps
- Jesse: fix tmux sizing issue; implement Postgres patterns.
- Carl: continue Picnic with latest Spark practices; deploy cl_draw and explore web-first over Atari automation.
- Both: establish the shared skills repository workflow.

## Notes
- Jesse can kill Carl’s SSH sessions while deploying fixes.
- Carl is not using Claude outside tmux in sensitive ways.
