# Technical Strategy Session

Run this for bigger-picture technical thinking.

---

## Prompt

```
Read my CTO system context files in context/.

I want to think through our technical strategy:

**Topic**: [What strategic question are you wrestling with?]

Some questions to help frame this:
- What's the right level of investment in infrastructure vs features?
- Build vs buy vs open source?
- When should we hire our first engineer?
- What technical bets are we making?
- Where should we take shortcuts vs invest in quality?

Challenge my assumptions. What am I missing? What would a world-class CTO do differently at this stage?

Context: 2-person team, pre-product, [add funding status if relevant].
```

## Competitive Analysis Prompt

```
Read my CTO system context.

Help me think about technical competitive positioning:

**Competitor/Alternative**: [Name]

1. What's their technical approach (based on public info)?
2. Where might they have technical advantages?
3. Where might we have technical opportunities?
4. What should we learn from them?
5. What should we intentionally do differently?
```
