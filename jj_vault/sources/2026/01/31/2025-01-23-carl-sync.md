# Carl Sync - 2025-01-23

## Jesse's Immediate Priorities

1. **TMUX sizing issue** (Carl's #1 blocker)
   - Not full-screen in SSH sessions
   - Control+L then `reset` provides temporary fix
   - Blocks effective vim/ncurses usage

2. **Postgres patterns** (~1hr timeboxed)
   - Persistent instances for production
   - Ephemeral instances for testing/verification
   - Backup and fork workflows for staging
   - Carl needs: simple persistent postgres + throwaway test instances

3. **SSH improvements**
   - Only one connection per node currently
   - SCP/SFTP not working (blocks Zed integration)
   - Z-links for remote editing failing

4. **Dev Spark containers with KVM**
   - Run Kate inside container with networking
   - Only needs to work from dev node

## Carl's Focus

- Picnic development with latest Spark best practices
- Loop chat (first Spark native app)
- cl_draw deployment and improvements

## Decisions

### Shared Skills Repository
- Create loop.work/skills repo
- Consolidate scattered skill definitions
- Manual sync initially, CLI tool later
- Skills directory with symlinks to Claude/agents

### External vs Internal Tool Separation
- Picnic needs standalone external capabilities
- Internal tools can leverage same underlying skills
- Avoid tight coupling that blocks external use cases
- "Spark native" doesn't mean coupled to internal systems

### CLI-First Pattern
- cl_draw with canvas manipulation + AI illustration
- Potential docs.loop.work with Prosemirror editor
- Chat interface with CLI backend

## Port 8080 Documentation Gap
- Recurring deployment issue across projects
- Need standardized HTTP service patterns

## Key Insight
"Spark native app" = agentic computing framework built on Spark. Picnic will be Spark native, but that doesn't mean it should be coupled to internal systems.

## Next Steps

| Who | Task |
|-----|------|
| Jesse | Fix TMUX sizing issue |
| Jesse | Implement Postgres patterns |
| Carl | Continue picnic with latest Spark practices |
| Carl | Deploy cl_draw, explore web-first over Atari automation |
| Both | Establish shared skills repository workflow |

## Notes

- Jesse can kill Carl's SSH sessions while deploying fixes
- Carl not using Claude outside of tmux in sensitive ways
- test_postgres.sh exists as reference for postgres setup
