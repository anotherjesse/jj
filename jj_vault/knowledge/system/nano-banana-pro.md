## Summary
**Nano Banana Pro** is referenced as a tool/model used for **high-quality image generation** in a workflow that turns CAD renders (e.g., depth maps) into realistic mockups (e.g., placing a part in an industrial setting).

## Notes
- Mentioned alongside a workflow: render CAD as **depth maps** → use as reference images for photorealistic/scene-context outputs.
