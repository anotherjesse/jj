## Constraints
- Team: 2-person team; 1 technical contributor.
- Funding stage: pre-funding / bootstrapped.

## Notes
These constraints should inform technical scope, tooling choices, and operational complexity.

## Source
- tech-stack (Last updated 2025-01-23)


## Update (LoopWork context)
- Company stage: pre-product; exploring product–market fit.
- Runway: approximately ~$2M cash.

> Note: This source indicates meaningful runway; prior notes describing the funding stage as “pre-funding / bootstrapped” may be outdated depending on how the ~$2M cash position was obtained.
