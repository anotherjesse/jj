## Statement
Prefer **CLI tools** and lightweight “skills” (markdown instructions + scripts) over heavy MCP-style schemas when possible, to preserve **context efficiency** and enable simpler composition.

## Details
- “Skills” are small bundles (instructions + scripts) that can be **loaded probabilistically** based on context signals.
- Example: a **frustration-triggered** skill that forces methodical debugging steps.
- Positioning: use **lightweight trigger summaries** rather than heavyweight MCP schema/context payloads.
