## Statement
LoopWork wants **comprehensive conversation capture** so future AI systems can browse organizational history when needed.

## Intended scope
- Claude Code sessions
- Internal chats (e.g., Loop chat)
- Calls / voice sessions (with logging)

## Motivation
- Improve long-horizon context and continuity for AI agents operating on behalf of the team.

## Implications / considerations
- Tooling should make capture automatic rather than manual.
- Requires explicit decisions on consent, privacy, retention, access control, and redaction.
