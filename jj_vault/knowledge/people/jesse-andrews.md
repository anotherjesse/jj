## Role
- CTO at LoopWork

## Location
- Berkeley, CA

## Profiles
- GitHub: @anotherjesse

## Background
- Built OpenStack at NASA (helped start the project and built the team).
- Planet.com: SVP Product/Engineering; scaled team to ~75; later Fellow.
- Deep AI experience (2018–2021): embeddings, autoencoders.
- Created userscripts.org; built multiple large open-source projects.

## Notable beliefs / insights
- Belief that LLMs can bridge communication gaps between disciplines (e.g., legal, product, engineering, marketing).
- Early LLM conviction influenced by Riley Goodside’s GPT-3 graphviz demo.
## Updates from Sparks source (2025-01-23)
- Sparks is described as Jesse’s **first Rust project** (quote: “if it compiles, it works”).
- Frames Sparks as “agentic-first cloud compute,” drawing an analogy to OpenStack’s enabling of new capabilities beyond cost savings (scale to thousands, back to zero; shift time/space).

## Notes
These items are beliefs/framings associated with Jesse in the Sparks design doc; they may also represent a broader team narrative, but are attributed to “Jesse” in the source text.
