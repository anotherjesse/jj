## Summary
Peter Steinberger is cited as the author of “Shipping at Inference-Speed” (Dec 2025), describing high-throughput workflows with advanced coding models (GPT‑5.2/Codex).

## Notable workflow claims (from source)
- The bottleneck becomes inference time and “hard thinking,” not coding.
- Work on many projects in parallel; queue tasks as ideas arrive.
- Prefer asking the model to change code over manual revert/edits; commit directly to main when solo.
- Maintain per-project docs folders to stabilize context; cross-reference other repos as exemplars.
