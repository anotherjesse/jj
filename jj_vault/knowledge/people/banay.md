## Summary
Banay is cited as the author of “Don’t Waste Your Back Pressure,” an article advocating automated feedback loops for AI agents.

## Mentioned work
- “Don’t Waste Your Back Pressure” — https://banay.me/dont-waste-your-backpressure/

## Attributed ideas
- Provide agents automated feedback (build/test/type errors, UI screenshots) so they can self-correct and handle longer-horizon tasks.
- Avoid spending human review time (“your back pressure”) on trivial, automatable errors.
