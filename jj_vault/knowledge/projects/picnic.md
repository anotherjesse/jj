## Summary
Picnic is a LoopWork application under development intended to follow the latest Spark/Sparks best practices. A key architectural requirement is that Picnic must have **standalone external capabilities** (not tightly coupled to internal-only systems), even if internal tools share underlying skills.

## Notes (2025-01-23 sync)
- Treated as a **Spark-native** app, where “Spark native” denotes an agentic computing framework built on Spark/Sparks rather than coupling to internal infrastructure.
- Explicit decision: keep **external vs. internal tool separation** so external use cases are not blocked by internal dependencies.

## Status
- Active development as of 2025-01-23.
