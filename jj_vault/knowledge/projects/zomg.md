## Summary
ZOMG is referenced as a prior experiment where a user could chat with an agent to build experiences and then “freeze” them into apps/widgets.

## Key takeaway (from Sparks doc)
Freezing agent-built experiences into static artifacts led to a **“deadness” problem**: the resulting apps felt dead/stuck in time, even if paired with a chatbot.

## Status
Only mentioned as prior work/experiment; no further details provided in this source.
