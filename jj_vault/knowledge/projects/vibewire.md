summary: 'Vibewire: LoopWork’s shelved dev-tools concept; pivoted to AI for media due to crowded market, some internal use, shifting to modular systems.'
---
## Summary
Vibewire was a developer-tools concept explored prior to LoopWork’s current “AI for media” direction. The company pivoted away from dev tools, citing an oversaturated market and heavy investment by large model companies.

## Current usage
- Parts of Vibewire are reportedly still used internally.

## Status
- Not the current product direction (pivoted away).


## Modularity direction (2026-01-24)
- JJ describes moving away from monolithic systems (Vibewire) toward **independent modular pieces** with LEGO-like composability (UNIX-style small tools).
- Examples of separated components:
  - Proto Kanban task manager
  - Sparks (container/forking)
  - Separate coding agents
