## Summary
Vibewire was a developer-tools concept explored prior to LoopWork’s current “AI for media” direction. The company pivoted away from dev tools, citing an oversaturated market and heavy investment by large model companies.

## Current usage
- Parts of Vibewire are reportedly still used internally.

## Status
- Not the current product direction (pivoted away).
