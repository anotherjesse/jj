summary: 'LoopWork cl_draw: CLI-first canvas manipulation + AI-assisted illustration backend, actively deployed and improving (2025-01-23).'
---
## Summary
cl_draw is a LoopWork project focused on **canvas manipulation** and **AI-assisted illustration**, with an explicit **CLI-first** product pattern. It is also an active deployment target.

## Notes (2025-01-23 sync)
- CLI-first: cl_draw as the backend/primitive; other interfaces (chat/web) may layer on top.
- Carl focus: deploy cl_draw and explore **web-first** approaches over Atari-style automation.

## Status
- Active work and deployment improvements as of 2025-01-23.
