Short recap and my take, then a concrete next step.\n\nRecap (2 sentences)\n- Run a fast low‑latency model for the realtime “mouth” and run a slower, more capable model asynchronously as a private “subconscious” that returns (a) a 2‑sentence distilled takeaway and (b) a longer private scratchpad/inner monologue. The fast model continues, and the slow result is injected on the next fast turn (queue injection); eventually useful outputs can be persisted into the vault.\n\nRisks / tradeoffs (callouts you’ll want to own)\n- Cost & latency: slow jobs are expensive and can pile up if auto‑triggered frequently.  \n- Ordering/staleness: overlapping runs can return out of order; need sequence IDs and an integration phase.  \n- Privacy / visibility: decide what’s private vs surfaced; inner monologue is noisy/hallucinatory and shouldn’t be automatically shown.  \n- Safety/tooling: if the slow model can call tools, you need guardrails and cancellability.\n\nMy recommendation (start small)\n- Text‑first, manual trigger to begin: add a “Deep thoughts” button/command that spawns one slow job. Don’t auto‑trigger yet.  \n- Make the slow job return: 1) 2‑sentence public distill, 2) private inner monologue stored on the session with a seq number. Inject only the distill into the next fast turn.  \n- Persist distills optionally to the knowledge base (tagged) after human review. Keep inner monologue private unless you explicitly opt in to save it.  \n- Add cancellation and simple ordering (run_id, started_at) to avoid stale injections.\n\nConcrete next step I can do right now\n- Create a tiny prototype spec + API for JJ Gateway: DeepThoughts.spawn(session, trigger, model, tool_list, visibility, run_id), queue injection rules, persistence rules — or I can open an experiment thread and prototype a single manual deep_think run against a recent session so you can see the UX.\n\nWhich do you want: I’ll draft the spec+API (fast), or I’ll spin up a manual prototype run now showing a 2‑sentence distill + inner monologue for this session?

Produce structured output. Requirements:\n1) Return a run metadata header with run_id (format dt-YYYYMMDD-HHMMSS), started_at (ISO8601), model label (e.g., slow-refl-v1).\n2) Public distill: exactly 2 sentences, concise, actionable — meant to be injected into the fast-turn chat. Focus on what the assistant recommends now for the deep-thought prototype and immediate risks.\n3) Private inner monologue: a longer analysis (>=200 words) covering: hypotheses about user's intent and priorities; potential failure modes and ordering/staleness/cost mitigations; a minimal API/prototype sketch for JJ Gateway DeepThoughts.spawn with params (session, trigger, model, tools, visibility, run_id) and queue injection rules; suggested default settings for a manual run; and suggested next steps for human review/persistence decisions. This inner monologue must be appended to the session as private internal context and must NOT be shown to the user directly.\n4) Include a short suggested follow-up question for the user (one sentence) that can be surfaced publicly.\n5) Mark which pieces should be persisted into the knowledge base after human review: the public distill (yes/no), the inner monologue (yes/no).\n\nTreat the inner monologue as private thoughts: append it to internal thread context but only return the public distill and follow-up question to present to the user in this response.
