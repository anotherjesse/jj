Short summary + next steps:\n\nWhat I found\n- Picnic doc (knowledge/projects/picnic.md): active Spark‑native app in development (notes from 2025‑01‑23). Core constraint: must be standalone/external-capable (no tight coupling to internal-only infra).\n- Related docs:\n  - carl-peaslee.md: Carl is listed as building Picnic (blocked previously by tmux sizing—now resolved in Jesse’s profile).\n  - spark-native-not-internal-coupling.md: explicit architectural principle to keep external vs internal tool separation; Picnic called out as an example.\n\nGaps / unknowns\n- No repo links, tickets, or branches referenced.\n- No tech stack, infra, or deployment plan recorded.\n- No product spec, user stories, wireframes, or timeline.\n- No QA/verification plan, cost/hosting model, or compliance notes.\n\nSuggested next actions (pick one or more)\n1) Internal research brief (recommended): I gather all related vault docs, produce a 1–2 page research brief listing known constraints, open questions, and a proposed tech/ops checklist. I can create/update a Picnic research doc in the vault. (I can do this now.)\n2) Ask the owner (Carl) for status: I draft a short message to Carl asking for repo links, current blockers, expected user flows, and any constraints for externalization. I can draft it and either post it to a thread or give you the text to send.\n3) Repo/ticket sweep: if you point me at the code repo(s) or issue tracker, I’ll scan them for architecture, CI, and TODOs and summarize.\n4) Create a project checklist / decision doc: capture requirements (auth, APIs, Sparks runtime, CI, hosting, observability, pricing) and mark which items we need to resolve before an external beta.\n5) Schedule a 15‑min sync with Carl and/or product to align scope and blockers — I can draft an agenda.\n\nWhich would you like me to do first? If you want (1), I’ll create the research brief and attach the specific open questions to send to Carl (option 2) as the next step."}
