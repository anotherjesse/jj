Background includes early work building OpenStack at NASA, leadership at Planet.com as SVP Product/Eng scaling the team to ~75, and deep AI work (2018–2021) including embeddings and autoencoders. He has built multiple large open-source projects (including userscripts.org) and formed early conviction in LLMs after seeing Riley Goodside’s GPT-3 graphviz demo. A key insight is that LLMs can bridge communication gaps across disciplines (e.g., legal/product/engineering/marketing).\n- Carl Peaslee (CEO, San Francisco, CA; GitHub @carlpeaslee). Characterized as technical plus business-oriented, able to both code and drive go-to-market.\n\nCurrent status: funding/runway is in place, but the product direction is still being defined; there is no MVP, no first users, and no revenue/market awareness yet.\n\nThe company previously explored a developer tools concept called Vibewire, with parts still used internally, but pivoted away from dev tools due to perceived oversaturation and heavy investment by large model companies.\n\nStrategically, LoopWork is considering two paths: (1) a product path building toward revenue, or (2) an awareness/reputation path aimed at increasing acquihire potential.\n\n*Source last updated: 2025-01-23*","confidence":0.9,"doc_path":"summaries/sources/company.md","sources_add":[{"event_ids":["src_01KGAKHQV1JD69416ZPE0RZ06Q"],"thread_id":""}],"status":"active","tags_add":["company","context","loopwork"],"title":"LoopWork - Company Context (source summary)","type":"source_summary"},"reason":"Create a source summary for the provided company context document (LoopWork)."},"reason":"Create a source summary for the provided company context document (LoopWork)."}
