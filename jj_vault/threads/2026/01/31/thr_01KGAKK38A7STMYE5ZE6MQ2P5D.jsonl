A backlog section exists but is essentially blank (single dash placeholder). The document was **last updated 2025-01-23**.\n\n## Key takeaways / implications\n- The plan is at a high level with placeholders (core features undefined), consistent with early-stage discovery.\n- Near-term process is intended to be sprint-based, but execution details have not been filled in yet.\n","confidence":0.74,"doc_path":"summaries/sources/roadmap.md","sources_add":[{"event_ids":["src_01KGAKK3894WSZRDHMV3ZCF7AF"]}],"tags_add":["roadmap","planning","technical"],"title":"Technical Roadmap (Discovery & Definition) — source summary","type":"source_summary"},"reason":"Create a source summary for the provided roadmap document."},"reason":"Create a source summary for the provided roadmap document."}
