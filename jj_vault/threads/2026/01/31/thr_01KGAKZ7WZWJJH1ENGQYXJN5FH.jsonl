It explicitly requests step-by-step reasoning and clarifying questions if needed.\n\n2) **Rubber Duck prompt**: A lighter-weight template for talking through a problem. The user explains what they are trying to do, and the assistant’s role is to ask questions that help the user find the answer themselves.\n\n## Notable details / constraints\n- The debugging prompt expects repo context (“Read the relevant code in this repo”).\n- Both prompts encourage clarifying questions; the debugging prompt also requests explicit hypothesis generation and investigation plan.\n","confidence":0.93,"doc_path":"summaries/sources/debug.md","sources_add":[{"event_ids":["src_01KGAKZ7WZ4HP7N9VGQ6A2S732"]}],"tags_add":["debugging","prompt","rubber-duck"],"title":"Debugging Session prompt template (debug)","type":"source_summary"},"reason":"Add a source summary for the provided 'Debugging Session' document so it can be referenced as a standard debugging prompt template."},"reason":"Add a source summary for the provided 'Debugging Session' document so it can be referenced as a standard debugging prompt template."}
