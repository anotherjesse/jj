Customer success and UI teams are onboarding to Claude Code to reduce dependency on engineering; backend/data migrations are approached more cautiously due to risk. MQL policy development is nearing fully autonomous generation.\n\nJesse describes a multi-agent approach using Claude Code and Codex CLI: Codex is preferred for longer-running architectural/back-end tasks (can run 20–30 minutes unattended; sometimes hours via compaction), while Claude is stronger for UI, DevOps, and shell scripting. Model selection is task-dependent (e.g., “High” for implementation vs “Extra High” for spec analysis/clarifying questions); Gemini is used for large-context analysis and PR documentation. Core cost thesis: human review/understanding time is now the scarce resource, not model inference.\n\nKey operational pattern: treat agent runs as probabilistic experiments rather than “golden PR” attempts. Run multiple implementations in parallel; if a run wedges, discard the sandbox and restart.\n\nReliability hinges on sandboxing + verification loops. Agents run in containers/VMs with limited blast radius; “YOLO” modes require explicit flags (e.g., `dangerously_allow_all` plus `IS_SANDBOX=1`). The “RALPH loop” concept is a simple while-loop that repeatedly instantiates a fresh agent session to pick the next incomplete task, make progress, commit when appropriate, then run lint/unit/integration tests and feed failures back. A longer (~25 minute) end-to-end verification loop deploys to full GCP/K8s environments.\n\nFor code review/understanding, Jesse uses Gemini to generate systematic PR narratives (“write for people who built this: what changed and why”), and requests justification when verification steps change. Tools mentioned include StageHand (BrowserBase) for LLM-driven visual/UI testing and “augmentation” tools for component annotation/feedback.\n\nThe discussion also covers philosophical shifts: faster iteration moves engineering value toward problem definition and system evolution, but creates enterprise risks (proliferation of many small, poorly understood systems) and raises concerns about junior engineering skill pipelines. A prediction is made that RL-fine-tuning advances will enable an explosion of LLM-friendly programming languages.\n","confidence":0.8,"doc_path":"summaries/sources/2025-01-23-chris-mondoo-agentic.md","sources_add":[{"event_ids":["src_01KGAMQP2QCND16S0Q271PWVCJ"],"thread_id":""}],"status":"active","tags_add":["agentic-coding","verification","multi-agent","sandboxing","claude","codex","gemini","sparks","skills"],"title":"Chris (Mondoo) — Agentic development discussion (2025-01-23)","type":"source_summary"},"reason":"Create source summary for the provided meeting notes so the vault has a concise, searchable record tied to the source ID."},"reason":"Create source summary for the provided meeting notes so the vault has a concise, searchable record tied to the source ID."}
