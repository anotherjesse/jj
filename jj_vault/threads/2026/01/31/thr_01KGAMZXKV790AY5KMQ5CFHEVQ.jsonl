The key v3 endpoint is `GET /api/v3/list/`, which supports filtering/pagination via `location` (`new`, `later`, `archive`, `feed`, `inbox`, `shortlist`), `category`, `tag`, `updatedAfter` (ISO 8601; intended for incremental sync), and `pageCursor`. Responses include document metadata (title/author/URLs), timestamps (saved/first opened/last opened), `reading_progress` (0–100; suggested threshold **≥85% = “read”**), plus `summary`, `notes`, `tags`, and `location`.\n\nFor highlights/notes, two approaches are described: (1) via v3 list where highlights are returned as documents with `parent_id`, or (2) via the v2 export endpoint (`GET /api/v2/export/`) for bulk highlight export including `text`, `note`, `location`, `color`, `highlighted_at`, and tags.\n\nThree integration options are evaluated:\n1) **MCP server** using an existing repo (Readwise-Reader-MCP) for on-demand queries, but with added latency and possible mismatch to needs.\n2) **Periodic sync to local markdown files** (recommended to start): scheduled script (hourly/daily) pulls updated documents since last sync, fetches highlights, and writes to a `reading/` directory (e.g., `inbox.md`, `in-progress.md`, `archive.md`, plus `reading/highlights/{doc-id}.md`). Benefits: always-available context, offline use, grep/search, version control; downside: staleness and data growth.\n3) **On-demand tool** providing functions like `readwise_search`, `readwise_recent(days)`, and `readwise_highlights(url)`, with freshness but implementation and rate-limit considerations.\n\nImplementation steps: store token as `READWISE_TOKEN`, write a sync script (Python/Rust pseudocode provided), schedule via cron/launchd, and update `CLAUDE.md` to document where reading data lives.\n\nOpen questions include how much history to sync, whether to store full text vs metadata+highlights, handling large lists to avoid bloating context, and possible tag-based filtering (e.g., only sync items tagged “work”).\n","confidence":0.9,"doc_path":"summaries/sources/reader-plan.md","sources_add":[{"event_ids":["src_01KGAMZXKVG13ZFCF7ET71Z06P"]}],"tags_add":["readwise","reader","integration","sync","api"],"title":"Readwise Reader Integration Plan (source summary)","type":"source_summary"},"reason":"Add a source summary capturing the Readwise Reader integration plan (periodic sync recommended, endpoints, folder layout, open questions) for future reference."},"reason":"Add a source summary capturing the Readwise Reader integration plan (periodic sync recommended, endpoints, folder layout, open questions) for future reference."}
