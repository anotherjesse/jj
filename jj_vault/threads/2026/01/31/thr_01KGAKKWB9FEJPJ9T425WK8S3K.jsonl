Each spark has its own root filesystem backed by **btrfs snapshots**, enabling fast lifecycle operations and hard snapshot/restore. The repository is `github.com/loopwork/sparks`, with a local path noted as `~/lw/sparks`. It is written in **Rust** and described as Jesse’s first Rust project (tagline: “if it compiles, it works”). Sparks is positioned as a spiritual successor to **Vibewire**, previously a monolithic Elixir system.\n\nThe philosophy emphasizes a **simple CLI that does one thing well**, avoiding an “all-in-one monster.” It distinguishes responsibilities: **coding agents** should own code and tests, while **humans** own verification via automated QA/smoke tests; agent-generated passing tests are not treated as sufficient proof of correctness.\n\nCore commands include lifecycle management (`spark create/delete/stop/resume`), running commands and shells (`spark exec/console`), snapshotting (`spark snapshot create/restore`), templating (`spark base`), persistent cross-spark volumes (`spark data`), and **1Password** integration (`spark secrets`). It supports project-based namespace isolation (auto-detected from git repos) and ephemeral sparks denoted with `-` that auto-delete on exit.\n\nSparks auto-mounts shared volumes: `/spark/bin` (global executables), `/spark/all` (global shared data), and `/spark/proj` (per-project shared data).\n\nThe broader vision frames Sparks as “agentic-first cloud compute,” analogous to OpenStack’s role for VMs. It argues that “frozen” agent-built apps feel “dead” and explores blurred boundaries between dev mode and shipped product, static apps vs. just-in-time interfaces, and human collaboration mediated by agents. A validated capability (2025-01-24) is that unannounced btrfs snapshots work with stateful apps: Postgres survives via WAL crash recovery, supporting “fork anything anytime.” Status as of 2025-01-23: focusing on making Sparks able to develop itself by moving development “onto the inside,” refining git workflows and source/data trust boundaries, and building composable “LEGOs.”","confidence":0.88,"doc_path":"summaries/sources/sparks.md","sources_add":[{"event_ids":["src_01KGAKKWB9TDHWX5V9423PZ1BG"],"thread_id":""}],"tags_add":["sparks","dev-tools","agentic-compute","containers","btrfs","rust"],"title":"sparks (source summary)","type":"source_summary"},"reason":"Add source summary for the provided Sparks document."},"reason":"Add source summary for the provided Sparks document."}
