The near-term focus (Q1 2025) is building “Cursor/Claude Code for media”: AI-assisted creative tooling, starting with images in Q1 and with interest in moving into video next.\n\nThe team consists of two founders:\n- Jesse Andrews (CTO, Berkeley, CA; GitHub @anotherjesse). Background includes early work building OpenStack at NASA, leadership at Planet.com as SVP Product/Eng scaling the team to ~75, and deep AI work (2018–2021) including embeddings and autoencoders. He has built multiple large open-source projects (including userscripts.org) and formed early conviction in LLMs after seeing Riley Goodside’s GPT-3 graphviz demo. A key insight is that LLMs can bridge communication gaps across disciplines (e.g., legal/product/engineering/marketing).\n- Carl Peaslee (CEO, San Francisco, CA; GitHub @carlpeaslee).
