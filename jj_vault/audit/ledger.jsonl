The Gateway is the control plane: it manages sessions, persists transcripts, coordinates a per-session serialized agent run loop (LLM streaming), and routes outbound responses back to the originating channel.\n\nCore design principles: session key is the unit of consistency; all state is derived from an append-only event log (JSONL transcript per session); the daemon is crash-only and restart-safe via replay/rehydration from `sessions.json` + transcripts; idempotency is required to make retries safe and prevent duplicate side effects (notably for Telegram update delivery and client reconnect retries).\n\nArchitecture components: Gateway Core (session manager, run coordinator, model provider interface, internal event bus/router), CLI Adapter (WebSocket client with streaming display and reconnect/resubscribe), and Telegram Adapter (long polling via `getUpdates`, mapping `tg:<chat_id>` to session keys, dedupe via durable offset/update tracking, and outbound `sendMessage`). Concurrency model: one active run per session key; cross-session concurrency allowed with a configurable global cap.\n\nPersistence layout defaults to `~/.jj/gateway/` with `sessions.json` as a small index (metadata + channel bindings) and `transcripts/<session_id>.jsonl` as source-of-truth logs (header + typed entries: `message`, `assistant_delta` optional, `assistant_final`, `error`). Idempotency can be implemented with a dedicated `dedupe/` store or via scanning recent transcript lines.\n\nGateway API for CLI: JSON frames over loopback WebSocket (`gateway.hello`, `session.open`, `session.send`, `session.subscribe`, `session.history`, dev-only `gateway.shutdown`), and events (`run.started`, `assistant.delta`, `assistant.final`, `run.completed`, `error`). Config lives at `~/.jj/gateway/config.toml` with sections for gateway, model provider, and Telegram; secrets must be env-var only. Deliverables include Rust workspace layout, tests (persistence, idempotency, WS happy path, Telegram dedupe with mocks), and docs (quickstart/protocol/storage).","sources_add":[{"thread_id":"","event_ids":["src_01KGAH9QWXDTVYBKPNG42FDGDE"]}]}}

It is explicitly **not** a coding agent; separate agents do implementation, though the assistant can write code for research/investigation.\n\nThe workflow is structured around persistent context management: at **session start**, read `priorities.md` and relevant files under `context/`. At **session end**, update `priorities.md` if priorities changed, add new information to `context/*.md`, and record significant technical decisions in `decisions/` using an ADR format. The file itself is meant to hold only pointers, with details living in `context/`, `ideas/`, and `decisions/`.\n\nOperational environment notes include repository locations: LoopWork work lives under `~/lw` (clone missing repos from `https://github.com/loopwork/<repo>.git`), and open-source work under `~/oss`. For web research, the assistant should search early, quote exact errors, and prefer sources from **2025–2026**.\n\nCompany/product context captured: LoopWork is pre-product with roughly **$2M runway**; Jesse is CTO (Berkeley) and **Carl** is CEO (SF).

A single long-running **Gateway daemon** acts as the control plane for **all messaging, session management, scheduling, and tool execution**. The Gateway owns channel connections (WhatsApp via Baileys, Telegram via grammY, Discord via discord.js, Slack via Bolt), enforces *one Gateway per host*, and exposes a loopback WebSocket control plane at `ws://127.0.0.1:18789`.\n\nClients (agent loop, CLI, WebChat UI, mobile nodes, internal scheduler) communicate with the Gateway using a typed JSON WebSocket protocol with frames `req`, `res`, and server-push `event` (streaming). The first frame must be an authenticated `connect` handshake; side-effecting methods (e.g., `agent`, `send`) require **idempotency keys** for safe retries.\n\nA core invariant is **per-session serialization**: inbound messages are routed by binding rules (channel/account/peer/guild; most-specific-wins) to an agent, then queued so only one run executes at a time per session key—analogous to a GenServer-per-session mailbox. The run pipeline is: intake/ack (`{runId, acceptedAt}`), queueing, context assembly (workspace files like `AGENTS.md`, `SOUL.md`, skills), model inference with tool calls, sandboxed tool execution with sanitization, streaming deltas over WebSocket, and persistence to JSONL transcripts with token accounting. Session keys are hierarchical (e.g., `agent:<agentId>:<channel>:dm:<peerId>`).\n\nScheduling is built into the Gateway via **cron jobs** and **heartbeats** (no separate scheduler daemon). Cron jobs can inject events into the main session or run in **isolated sessions** (`cron:<jobId>`) that post results back to main; jobs persist at `~/.openclaw/cron/jobs.json` and concurrency is bounded (`maxConcurrentRuns`). Heartbeats (default 30 min) run proactive checks driven by `HEARTBEAT.md`.\n\nCoordination relies on the Gateway control plane plus optional, allowlisted **agent-to-agent tools** (`sessions_send`, `sessions_spawn`). Sub-agents run in isolated sessions (`agent:<agentId>:subagent:<uuid>`) and cannot recursively spawn further subagents by default.\n\nDurable memory is file-based: daily append-only logs under `~/.openclaw/workspace/memory/YYYY-MM-DD.md`, curated `MEMORY.md`, and JSONL session transcripts. Each agent has an isolated workspace/session store/auth profile to prevent credential leakage.\n\nTools use **TypeBox** schemas for compile-time and runtime validation (with restrictions such as avoiding unions), and higher-level **Skills** are defined in `SKILL.md` with YAML frontmatter and a precedence order (workspace > managed > bundled) gated by environment/binaries/OS requirements. Tool access is controlled by per-agent allow/deny lists, presets, and tool groups.\n\nThe piece highlights patterns: single-daemon gateway control plane, provider/channel abstractions, session-based serialization, layered configuration, DI via a factory (`createDefaultDeps`), and security layering (DM/group policies → tool policy → sandbox → exec approvals). OpenClaw optimizes for single-user local deployment; horizontal scaling would require session affinity and shared state, representing a major architectural change.\n","sources_add":[{"thread_id":"","event_ids":["src_01KGAHKH7MWX9B27SKEBRWXNJR"]}]}}

Sparks is presented as a spiritual successor to **Vibewire**, a previous monolithic Elixir system.\n\nThe product philosophy emphasizes a **simple CLI** that does one thing well, with a clear division of responsibilities: **coding agents** own the code and tests, while **humans own verification** via QA/smoke tests; agent-written tests passing are treated as necessary but not sufficient (“outsourced dev” analogy).\n\nCore CLI capabilities include lifecycle management (`spark create/delete/stop/resume`), command execution and shells (`spark exec/console`), snapshotting (`spark snapshot create/restore`), templating (`spark base`), persistent volumes across sparks (`spark data`), and secrets management via **1Password integration** (`spark secrets`). Sparks supports “projects” for namespace isolation (auto-detected from git repos) and **ephemeral sparks** designated with `-` that auto-delete on exit.\n\nSparks auto-mounts shared volumes: `/spark/bin` (global executables), `/spark/all` (global shared data), and `/spark/proj` (per-project shared data).\n\nStrategically, Sparks is framed as “**agentic-first cloud compute**”: infrastructure that makes agentic workloads feel like cloud did for VMs (time/space shifting, scale up/down). A key motivation is the “**deadness**” of freezing agent-built experiences into static apps; Sparks explores blurred boundaries between dev mode vs shipped product and human collaboration mediated by agents. A validated capability (2025-01-24) is that **hard btrfs snapshots work with stateful apps** like Postgres without coordination (WAL crash recovery suffices), supporting “fork anything anytime.”\n\n(Last updated in source: 2025-01-23)\n","sources_add":[{"thread_id":"","event_ids":["src_01KGAHQM5C1W0DZ2N3XS49GQPP"]}]}}

Banay’s *Don’t Waste Your Back Pressure* argues that you should stop spending human attention on trivial mistakes and instead give agents the ability to run builds/tests, interpret errors, and iterate until inconsistencies are eliminated; typed languages and high-quality error messages (e.g., Rust/Elm) act as natural back pressure. The collection also points to iterative “loop” styles (e.g., RALPH loops) and UI verification via browser/screenshot automation.\n\nPractitioner workflow guidance (Peter Steinberger’s *Shipping at Inference-Speed*) claims that with modern coding models (GPT‑5.2/Codex), the bottleneck is inference time and “hard thinking,” not coding. Patterns include running multiple projects in parallel, heavily using queues, asking the model to revise rather than reverting, planning collaboratively then issuing a “build” command, and relying less on reading code line-by-line. Context practices include maintaining per-project docs folders and reusing patterns across repos by referencing other directories.\n\nFactory.ai’s *Agent Readiness* frames inconsistent agent results as primarily a **codebase readiness** issue. It provides eight pillars (pre-commit hooks, environment/build docs, tests, CI/CD, security scanning, CODEOWNERS, branch protection) and maturity levels, recommending actionable metrics like the percentage of repos that are “agent-ready.”\n\nThe collection broadens beyond coding: Joel Simon’s *Lluminate* uses evolutionary search and explicit creativity strategies to counter LLM homogeneity and promote novelty, and fast.ai’s close-reading workflow describes using LLMs to read deeply by summarizing chapters, avoiding spoilers, and generating end-of-chapter context for continuation.\n\nFinally, Cloudflare’s *Code Mode* proposes an architecture where the LLM writes TypeScript that calls MCP tools (rather than calling tools directly), executed in a V8 isolate sandbox with no internet and protected secrets.\n\n## Cross-cutting takeaways (as stated)\n- Context management is foundational (summaries-of-summaries, docs folders, JIT loading).\n- Automated feedback beats human review for correctness.\n- Run many experiments instead of seeking one perfect attempt.\n- Start with CLI interfaces so agents can close the loop.\n- As models improve, reduce scaffolding and rebuild SDLC assumptions around new constraints.\n","sources_add":[{"thread_id":"","event_ids":["src_01KGAHWXK99F9EMPAY5CMPCB43"]}]}}
