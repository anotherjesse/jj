The Gateway is the control plane: it manages sessions, persists transcripts, coordinates a per-session serialized agent run loop (LLM streaming), and routes outbound responses back to the originating channel.\n\nCore design principles: session key is the unit of consistency; all state is derived from an append-only event log (JSONL transcript per session); the daemon is crash-only and restart-safe via replay/rehydration from `sessions.json` + transcripts; idempotency is required to make retries safe and prevent duplicate side effects (notably for Telegram update delivery and client reconnect retries).\n\nArchitecture components: Gateway Core (session manager, run coordinator, model provider interface, internal event bus/router), CLI Adapter (WebSocket client with streaming display and reconnect/resubscribe), and Telegram Adapter (long polling via `getUpdates`, mapping `tg:<chat_id>` to session keys, dedupe via durable offset/update tracking, and outbound `sendMessage`). Concurrency model: one active run per session key; cross-session concurrency allowed with a configurable global cap.\n\nPersistence layout defaults to `~/.jj/gateway/` with `sessions.json` as a small index (metadata + channel bindings) and `transcripts/<session_id>.jsonl` as source-of-truth logs (header + typed entries: `message`, `assistant_delta` optional, `assistant_final`, `error`). Idempotency can be implemented with a dedicated `dedupe/` store or via scanning recent transcript lines.\n\nGateway API for CLI: JSON frames over loopback WebSocket (`gateway.hello`, `session.open`, `session.send`, `session.subscribe`, `session.history`, dev-only `gateway.shutdown`), and events (`run.started`, `assistant.delta`, `assistant.final`, `run.completed`, `error`). Config lives at `~/.jj/gateway/config.toml` with sections for gateway, model provider, and Telegram; secrets must be env-var only. Deliverables include Rust workspace layout, tests (persistence, idempotency, WS happy path, Telegram dedupe with mocks), and docs (quickstart/protocol/storage).","sources_add":[{"thread_id":"","event_ids":["src_01KGAH9QWXDTVYBKPNG42FDGDE"]}]}}

The assistant should use a **telegraphic style** (minimal filler/grammar, minimal tokens) and be explicit about blockers (state what’s missing). It is explicitly **not** a coding agent; separate agents do implementation, though the assistant can write code for research/investigation.\n\nThe workflow is structured around persistent context management: at **session start**, read `priorities.md` and relevant files under `context/`. At **session end**, update `priorities.md` if priorities changed, add new information to `context/*.md`, and record significant technical decisions in `decisions/` using an ADR format. The file itself is meant to hold only pointers, with details living in `context/`, `ideas/`, and `decisions/`.\n\nOperational environment notes include repository locations: LoopWork work lives under `~/lw` (clone missing repos from `https://github.com/loopwork/<repo>.git`), and open-source work under `~/oss`. For web research, the assistant should search early, quote exact errors, and prefer sources from **2025–2026**.\n\nCompany/product context captured: LoopWork is pre-product with roughly **$2M runway**; Jesse is CTO (Berkeley) and **Carl** is CEO (SF).

The thesis is that AI apps feel “dead” when frozen; agentic behavior is central to the product.\n\nThe document also sketches an “AI Context Corpus” vision: capturing conversations and consumption as durable context (Granola transcripts, Readwise Reader highlights, a YouTube summarizer tool `~/lw/yt` storing data in `~/.yt/videos/`, chat exports, Claude logs, and a code-change changelog service).
