## Summary
LoopWork is a pre-product company exploring product–market fit with roughly **$2M cash runway**. The stated focus for **Q1 2025** is building “**Cursor/Claude Code for media**”: AI-assisted creative tooling, **starting with images** in Q1 and expressing interest in **video next**.

The team consists of **Jesse Andrews (CTO, Berkeley, CA; GitHub @anotherjesse)** and **Carl Peaslee (CEO, San Francisco, CA; GitHub @carlpeaslee)**. Jesse’s background includes initiating and building **OpenStack at NASA**, leading product/engineering at **Planet.com** (growing an org to ~75), and deep AI work (2018–2021) including **embeddings** and **autoencoders**, plus multiple open source projects including **userscripts.org**. An explicit belief/insight attributed to Jesse is that LLMs can **bridge communication gaps across disciplines** (e.g., legal/product/engineering/marketing).

LoopWork’s current status is described as: cash runway secured, but **product not yet defined**, **no MVP**, **no first users**, and **no revenue/market awareness** yet.

Previously, the company worked on **Vibewire**, a dev-tools concept; some parts remain used internally. LoopWork pivoted away from dev tools due to perceived oversaturation and heavy investment by major model companies.

Two strategic options are outlined: (1) a **product path** focused on building toward revenue, and (2) an **awareness path** focused on reputation-building with potential **acquihire** outcomes.
