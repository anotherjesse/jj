## Summary
This source is a **generic technical roadmap template** with checklists and placeholders, intended to track progress from early discovery through launch and iteration.

- **Current phase:** *Discovery & Definition*.
- **Milestone structure:** Four phases with high-level tasks:
  1. **Foundation:** define product scope, choose technical stack, set up dev environment, create initial architecture.
  2. **MVP:** implement three unspecified core features and a basic deployment pipeline.
  3. **Launch:** add user authentication, production infrastructure, monitoring/alerting, and perform the initial launch.
  4. **Iteration:** integrate user feedback, optimize performance, and expand features.
- **Sprint tracking:** includes a section for the **week of 2025-01-23** with empty “This Week” and “Next Week” task lists.
- **Backlog:** placeholder section with no items filled in.

## Notable gaps / to be completed
- No product-specific scope, features, owners, or definitions of “Core feature 1–3”.
- No dates (beyond the sprint week) or acceptance criteria for milestones.

*Last updated in source: 2025-01-23.*
