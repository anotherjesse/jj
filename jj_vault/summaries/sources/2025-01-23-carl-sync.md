## Summary
This doc captures a 2025-01-23 sync between Jesse and Carl, centered on unblocking day-to-day development on Sparks infrastructure and aligning on product/architecture direction for LoopWork apps.

**Immediate priorities (Jesse/CTO):**
1) Fix a **tmux sizing/TTY issue** in SSH sessions (temporary workaround: `Ctrl+L` then `reset`), which blocks effective Vim/ncurses use.
2) Define **Postgres instance patterns** (timeboxed ~1 hour): simple **persistent Postgres** for production plus **throwaway/ephemeral instances** for testing/verification; include backup and fork workflows for staging. A `test_postgres.sh` script exists as reference.
3) Improve **SSH**: currently only one connection per node; **SCP/SFTP** not working (blocks Zed integration); “Z-links” remote editing failing.
4) Support **Dev Spark containers with KVM**: run Kate inside a container with networking, only needs to work from the dev node.

**Carl’s focus:** continue **Picnic** development using the latest Spark best practices; build **Loop chat** (framed as the first Spark-native app); deploy and improve **cl_draw**.

**Key decisions/insights:**
- Create a shared **`loop.work/skills` repository** to consolidate scattered “skill definitions”; start with manual sync, later add a CLI tool; use a `skills/` directory with symlinks into Claude/agent directories.
- Maintain **external vs internal tool separation**: Picnic needs standalone external capabilities; internal tools can reuse underlying skills, but avoid coupling that blocks external use cases.
- Prefer a **CLI-first** pattern that can back chat or web UIs (examples: cl_draw canvas manipulation + AI illustration; potential docs.loop.work with Prosemirror editor).
- There is a recurring **port 8080 deployment/documentation gap**; standard HTTP service patterns are needed.

**Operational notes:** Jesse can kill Carl’s SSH sessions while deploying fixes; Carl isn’t using Claude outside tmux in sensitive ways.
