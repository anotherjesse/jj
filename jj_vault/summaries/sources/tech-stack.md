## Summary
This document is a placeholder for capturing **technical stack choices and engineering decisions**. It outlines four stack areas**Frontend**, **Backend**, **Infrastructure**, and **Third-party services**but all specific technology selections are currently **TBD**.

It also establishes an intent to document **technical principles** (a numbered list is present but empty) and explicitly records early **constraints** shaping decisions:
- The team is **2 people**, with **1 technical** contributor.
- The company is **pre-funding/bootstrapped**.
- **Speed to market is critical**.

The document is marked as last updated **2025-01-23** and should be updated as concrete decisions are made.
